# ChronosDB Docs

This folder contains user- and operator-focused documentation built on top of the main `README.md` and an internal production-readiness checklist.

- `prod-deployment-guide.md` – high-level guide for deploying a small ChronosDB cluster in production-like environments (3-node cluster, edge→cloud).

Over time, more guides can be added here:

- Troubleshooting and incident playbooks.
- Architecture diagrams and deeper explanations of Raft, sync, and storage.
- Integration examples for specific edge/IoT deployments.

For now, also see the repo root `README.md` for quickstart and demos.
